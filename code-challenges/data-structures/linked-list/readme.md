# Linked List Implementation
The task was to create two classes: Node and LinkedList. Both should be exported by this file.

## Challenge
Node should have the properties: val, next, and prev (although prev was for a stretch goal).

LinkedList should have the head property as well as the following methods: insert(), includes(), and toString().

We should write tests to prove:
- Your LinkedList can successfully instantiate an empty list
- You can properly insert a value into the list
- Your LinkedList head property will correctly point to the beginning of the list
- You can insert multiple Nodes into the list successfully
- Your includes() function correctly finds a value in the list that exists
- Your includes() function correctly returns false when a value is not in the list
- Your toString() function prints out your LinkedList in an expected way
    
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O for adding nodes is O(1). Big O for printing the list of nodes is 0(n).
    
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
No APIs used.

## Testing
<!-- Description of how to run your tests -->
Tried to get tests running. I am bad at this. Hit a weird error and am stuck. Will bring up during lecture to see where I went wrong.
