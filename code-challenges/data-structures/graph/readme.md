# Graphs
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

## Challenge
Include the following methods:

* AddNode()
  * Adds a new node to the graph
  * Takes in the value of that node
  * Returns the added node

* AddEdge()
  * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  * Include the ability to have a “weight”
  * Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
    * Both nodes should already be in the Graph

* GetNodes()
  * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

* GetNeighbors()
  * Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
  * Takes in a given node
  * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

* Size()
  * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
- `addNode()`
- `addEdge()`
- `getNodes()`
- `getNeighbors()`
- `size()`
