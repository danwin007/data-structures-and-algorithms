# Challenge Summary
Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Challenge Description
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency
I messed up and misunderstood the question. I tried to look for guides to show how to find the cheapest path between two nodes. I didn't realize I needed to just check if edges existed and return the total weight of the edges. Now it's kind of late. I will try to refactor tomorrow :(
