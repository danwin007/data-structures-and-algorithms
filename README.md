Space for Code Fellows daily code challenges

Here I will focus on compiling and working on the daily code challenges that will be assigned in class each day. 

This will allow me to sharpen my code skills and serve as a good warm up before the day's work.

# Reverse an Array

For this challenge, we were asked to reverse an array out of place. 

## Challenge

We are not to use any built-in methods. Any methods we write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts.

## Solution
